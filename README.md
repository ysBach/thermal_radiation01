* ``yssbtmpy_ana2021``: Snapshot of the under-development package, ``yssbtmpy`` used for this work.
* ``accutil.py``: Utility scripts. (``accutil_archive.py`` is saved purely for legacy purpose - please don't use it.)
* ``eph17.csv``, ``phae_ephem.csv``: Cached ephemerides to plot in ``06-Theta_rh.ipynb``.



### NOTE

At this stage, the output data from ``04-accplot.ipynb`` (all the ``.nc`` files) are available either

1. you can make it from the code at ``04-accplot.ipynb``, or
2. via figshare (doi: 10.6084/m9.figshare.12044883) - **not published yet -- will be published as soon as the paper is accepted**.

For the first option, you are free to go ahead. For the second option, download it, unzip it, and put two ``*.nc`` files (except thos indicated by ``bck``, which means "backup") to ``data/`` directory.



### Requirements

* python 3.6+
* matplotlib
* scipy
* numpy 
* pandas 
* astropy
* xarray
  * install netcdf4 by ``conda install -c conda-forge netcdf4 --yes``
* numba
  * ``yssbtmpy_ana2021`` requires numba for TPM calculation.

You may make a virture environment using, e.g., conda, ``conda create -n thermal_ana2021 matplotlib scipy numpy pandas astropy xarray netcdf4 numba`` and then ``conda activate thermal_ana2021``. You may have to specify versions of packages.
