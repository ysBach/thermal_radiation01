thermal radiation test

nbviewer [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ysbach/thermal_radiation01/tree/master/).

At this stage, the output data (all the ``.nc`` files) are available either

1. you can make it from the code at ``04-accplot.ipynb``, or
2. via my personal [Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/pcmqzwifgbukgc6/data_nc.tar.gz?dl=0).

For the first option, you are free to go ahead. For the second option, download it, unzip it, and put all ``*.nc`` files to ``data/`` directory.
